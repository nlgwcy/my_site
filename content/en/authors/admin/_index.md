Kmesh is a high-performance service grid data plane software implemented based on the ebpf and programmable kernel. It adopts the sidecarless architecture and does not need to deploy proxy components on the data plane. It implements the service governance function and improves the forwarding performance of service access.

At present, the latency and noise floor overhead of the data plane of the service grid has become a key problem in the development of the service grid technology, and the data plane technologies are diverse. We are committed to providing customers with a lighter and more efficient service governance capability to meet customers' requirements for security, agility, and efficiency.
